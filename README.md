# First-Hand
A font family created by employees of Lincoln Public Schools (Lincoln, Nebraska) to meet the needs of our elementary school teachers. Hopefully they will be of use to primary teachers world-wide via G SUite.

Original glyphs were obtained from the SIL Open Font Licensed typefaces Questrial, Varela Round, Raleway, and Poppins typefaces. All original glyphs were modified prior to inclusion in the First Hand typefaces in one way or another. 

The First Hand typeface is similar to and inspired by the Zaner-Bloser typeface, but are original creations that differ from the letterforms created by Zaner-Bloser. The First Hand typefaces might be used in conjunction with the Zaner-Bloser method of handwriting instruction, but they are not manufactured by Zaner-Bloser, Inc. or their licensees. Zaner-Bloser Â® is the copyright and trademark of Zaner-Bloser Inc. in the United States or other countries.
