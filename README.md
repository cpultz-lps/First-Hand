# First-Hand
A font family created to meet the needs of elementary school teachers creating materials to help primary students learn the basics of print handwriting.

Original glyphs were sourced from the SIL Open Font Licensed typefaces Questrial, Varela Round, Raleway, and Poppins typefaces. All original glyphs were modified in one way or another prior to inclusion in the First Hand typefaces. 

The First Hand typeface is inspired by the Zaner-Bloser typeface, but are original creations that differ from the letterforms created by Zaner-Bloser in some key ways. (Alternate descenders, letter widths, etc.) The First Hand typefaces might be used in conjunction with traditional methods of handwriting instruction, but they are not manufactured by Zaner-Bloser, Inc. or their licensees. Zaner-BloserÂ® is the copyright and trademark of Zaner-Bloser Inc. in the United States or other countries.
